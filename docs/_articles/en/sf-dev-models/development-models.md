## Overview

Salesforce Extensions for VS Code supports Org Development and Package Development models to authorize, create and switch orgs in your project:

- [Org Development Model](orgdev.md): Allows you work with orgs that don’t have source tracking, such as sandbox, Developer Edition (DE) org, Trailhead Playground, or even a production org to retrieve and deploy code directly.
- [Package Development Model](packagedev.md): Allows you to create self-contained applications or libraries that are deployed to your org as a single package. These packages are typically developed against source-tracked orgs such as scratch orgs. This development model uses org source tracking, source control, and continuous integration and deployment.

Salesforce Extensions for VS Code runs commands against the org that you’ve set as your default org for development.
